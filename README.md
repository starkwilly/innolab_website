## Innolab React Bootstrap base

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## For styling the base is React Bootstrap

- [https://react-bootstrap.github.io](https://react-bootstrap.github.io)
- Font Awesome React [https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react)
- Axios for API consume [https://github.com/axios/axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start:dev`

- This task first trigger the `npm install` command, to install or update any added dependencies to the package.json.
- Then runs the `start:api` to start the API local emulator.
- Runs the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode with only support for ES6.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start:legacy`

Runs the app in the development mode with transpile of ES6 to ES5.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run lint`

Launches the linter.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.<br>
See the section about [Configuring ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) for more information.
